## ðŸ‘‹ Hi There! ##
Hi, Iâ€™m Nicole Yoong from United Kingdom, a fresh graduate of MSc Computing Science who has huge passion in data analytics. 

Fascinated by the impact of data on business operations, I am a prospective data analyst who is experienced in various application of data analysis using programming languages including SQL and Python.
A background in the marketing industry coupled with strong data analysis skills will bring unique insights to this role.
