## üëã Hi There! ##
Hi, I‚Äôm Nicole Yoong from United Kingdom, a fresh graduate of MSc Computing Science who has huge passion in data analytics. 

Fascinated by the impact of data on business operations, I am a prospective data analyst who is experienced in various application of data analysis using programming languages including SQL and Python.
A background in the marketing industry coupled with strong data analysis skills will bring unique insights to this role. 
The active development of personal projects exposes me to understand the importance of having an iterative and hypothesis-approach to analysis. 
I am keen to build on these skills in an exciting new role.
